module Region = Region

type 'a t
(** ['a t] is a reference to an Io_uring structure. *)

type 'a job
(** A handle for a submitted job, which can be used to cancel it.
    If an operation returns [None], this means that submission failed because the ring is full. *)

val create : ?fixed_buf_len:int -> ?polling_timeout:int -> queue_depth:int -> unit -> 'a t
(** [create ?fixed_buf_len ~queue_depth] will return a fresh Io_uring structure
    [t]. Each [t] has associated with it a fixed region of memory that is used
    for the "fixed buffer" mode of io_uring to avoid data copying between
    userspace and the kernel.
    @param polling_timeout If given, use polling mode with the given idle timeout (in ms).
                           This requires privileges. *)

val queue_depth : 'a t -> int
(** [queue_depth t] returns the total number of submission slots for the uring [t] *)

val buf : 'a t -> Cstruct.buffer
(** [buf t] is the fixed internal memory buffer associated with uring [t].
    You will normally want to wrap this with {!Region.alloc} or similar
    to divide the buffer into chunks. *)

val realloc : 'a t -> Cstruct.buffer -> unit
(** [realloc t buf] will replace the internal fixed buffer associated with
    uring [t] with a fresh one.
    @raise Invalid_argument if there are any requests in progress *)

val exit : 'a t -> unit
(** [exit t] will shut down the uring [t]. Any subsequent requests will fail.
    @raise Invalid_argument if there are any requests in progress *)

val probe : unit -> bool
(** [probe ()] checks whether or not the necessary io_uring operations are available.
    The function returns [true] if all are available and [false] otherwise. *)

(** {2 Queueing operations} *)

val noop : 'a t -> 'a -> 'a job option
(** [noop t d] submits a no-op operation to uring [t]. The user data [d] will be
    returned by {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

    @param access controls whether the file is opened for reading, writing, or both
    @param flags are the usual open flags
    @param perm sets the access control bits for newly created files (subject to the process's umask)

(** [poll_add t fd mask d] will submit a [poll(2)] request to uring [t].
    It completes and returns [d] when an event in [mask] is ready on [fd]. *)

type offset := Optint.Int63.t
(** For files, give the absolute offset, or use [Optint.Int63.minus_one] for the current position.

(** [readv t ~file_offset fd iov d] will submit a [readv(2)] request to uring [t].
    It reads from absolute [file_offset] on the [fd] file descriptor and writes
    the results into the memory pointed to by [iov].  The user data [d] will
    be returned by {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

val writev : 'a t -> file_offset:offset -> Unix.file_descr -> Cstruct.t list -> 'a -> 'a job option
(** [writev t ~file_offset fd iov d] will submit a [writev(2)] request to uring [t].
    It writes to absolute [file_offset] on the [fd] file descriptor from the
    the memory pointed to by [iov].  The user data [d] will be returned by
    {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

val read_fixed : 'a t -> file_offset:offset -> Unix.file_descr -> off:int -> len:int -> 'a -> 'a job option
(** [read t ~file_offset fd ~off ~len d] will submit a [read(2)] request to uring [t].
    It reads up to [len] bytes from absolute [file_offset] on the [fd] file descriptor and
    writes the results into the fixed memory buffer associated with uring [t] at offset [off].
    The user data [d] will be returned by {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

(** [write t ~file_offset fd off d] will submit a [write(2)] request to uring [t].
    It writes up to [len] bytes into absolute [file_offset] on the [fd] file descriptor
    from the fixed memory buffer associated with uring [t] at offset [off].
    The user data [d] will be returned by {!wait} or {!peek} upon completion. *)

val splice : 'a t -> src:Unix.file_descr -> dst:Unix.file_descr -> len:int -> 'a -> 'a job option
(** [splice t ~src ~dst ~len d] will submit a request to copy [len] bytes from [src] to [dst].
    The operation returns the number of bytes transferred, or 0 for end-of-input.
    The result is [EINVAL] if the file descriptors don't support splicing. *)

val connect : 'a t -> Unix.file_descr -> Unix.sockaddr -> 'a -> 'a job option

(** [cancel t job d] submits a request to cancel [job].
    The cancel job itself returns 0 on success, or [ENOTFOUND]
    if [job] had already completed by the time the kernel processed the cancellation request.
    @raise Invalid_argument if the job has already been returned by e.g. {!wait}. *)

(** {2 Submitting operations} *)

  | Some of { result: int; data: 'a } (**)
(** The type of results of calling {!wait} and {!peek}. [None] denotes that

    occurred. [Some] contains both the user data attached to the completed
    request and the integer syscall result. *)

val wait : ?timeout:float -> 'a t -> 'a completion_option
(** [wait ?timeout t] will block indefinitely (the default) or for [timeout]
    seconds for any outstanding events to complete on uring [t]. Events should
    have been queued via {!submit} previously to this call. *)

(** [peek t] looks for completed requests on the uring [t] without blocking. *)
